      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        The Enlightenment Club was founded in 2015 by a group of passionate Muslim intellectuals who recognized the need for a platform that could foster critical thinking and intellectual discourse within the Islamic community. Our founders were driven by the desire to revive the rich tradition of Islamic scholarship and apply it to contemporary challenges.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Since our inception, we have grown from a small local group to an international organization with members across the globe. Our journey has been marked by numerous milestones, including the launch of our popular podcast series, the establishment of our annual conference, and the development of our comprehensive membership program.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Throughout our history, we have remained committed to our core values of intellectual rigor, open dialogue, and the pursuit of knowledge grounded in Islamic principles.
